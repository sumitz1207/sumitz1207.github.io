          <h2>Correlations Between Healthcare Gap and Poverty Levels</h2>
          <p>As we can see in the above graph, there is a notable relationship between lack of healthcare coverage and poverty. 
            In states with high levels of poverty, particularly in the Deep South and Appalacian region, we see a corresponding
             high level of lacking healthcare coverage. Conversely, we see low levels of poverty and healthcare defiencies in the
              more northern states, especially the New England region. This would suggest that high levels of poverty are a barrier
               for state citizens in achieving healthcare coverage, especially in states lacking universal healthcare policies.
                Some states that stand out in the data include Texas, which appears to have the highest lack of healthcare coverage
                 despite a mid-level income level. New Hampshire appears to have the lowest level of poverty, but is outdone by states
                  like Massachusetts in healthcare, perhaps due to healthcare mandate policies.
